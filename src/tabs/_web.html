<p>I love the web. It's an amazing platform, and I'm still surprised by what it's capable of. I've been making websites for... a distressingly long time. Most of my life? I made this website right here. It's pretty nice, right? Works well, clean, effective.</p>
<p>I work full-stack, from wrangling databases to CSS prettiness. I prefer to work with Python/Django but have plenty of experience with other languages and frameworks. If that's all greek to you, don't worry &ndash; just fire off an email and we can work together to make something great.</p>
