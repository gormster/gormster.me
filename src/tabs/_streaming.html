<p>mostly play minecraft, geoguessr, city builders, board games. whatever takes my fancy really. all streams have 100% original music, usually being played live. if you're wondering why i keep looking at something off screen, that's why :P</p>
<p>recently completed a 24 hour board game marathon on @msgstreamteam; we raised $2,250 for cancer council australia, which i'm super proud of.</p>
