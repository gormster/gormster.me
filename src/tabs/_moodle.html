<p>From 2009 to 2020 I worked at <a href="https://eng.unsw.edu.au">UNSW Engineering</a>, designing, developing and deploying learning and teaching software. We made a lot of things I'm very proud of, but the biggest project by far was Moodle, the open source learning platform. We made lots of plugins and modifications for Moodle, working to make it work better for our teachers and students.</p>
<p>Some of that work was open-sourced, and now lives a sedate life on my GitHub page. That includes the massive <a href="https://github.com/gormster/moodle-local_teameval">Team Evaluation</a>, a plugin that rewards individual contributions in group projects; <a href="https://github.com/gormster/moodle-mod_workshep">Enhanced Workshop</a>, a version of the Workshop activity that allows for Team-Based Learning; and <a href="https://github.com/gormster/moodle-local_assignbulk">Assignment Bulk Upload</a>, a tool that allows for bulk upload of assignment submissions, extremely useful for scanned exam papers!</p>
<p>I left UNSW at the end of 2020 having put 11 years into Moodle. You probably won't find someone who knows it better outside of Perth.</p>
